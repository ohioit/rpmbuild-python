# Python Module RPM Generator

This repo is intended for generating RPM packages from Python modules. Initially it just builds
packages against the default base Python 2.7 installed with CentOS7, but it could be extended to
support multiple Python versions currently available from EPEL and/or SCL.

## Requirements

- Vagrant <https://www.vagrantup.com/>
- VirtualBox <https://www.virtualbox.org/>
- Ansible <https://www.ansible.com/>
